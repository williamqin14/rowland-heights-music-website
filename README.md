## Interesting Things About This Project
* Is a git-based CMS setup rather than API-based setup, meaning all editable content is stored in github repository. See /content folder, no backend needed!
* Maintenance free, client can edit all content using Decap CMS
* Uses Cloudinary to outsource image storage, saving space and build time
* Only costs **$5/year** to run instead of **$100+/year**, just have to pay for domain ðŸ˜Ž
