## Interesting Things About This Project
* Originally configured to work with Wordpress CMS + graphql, but scrapped due to free version of wordpress.com not offering plugin support
* Is a git-based CMS setup rather than API-based setup, meaning all editable content is stored in github repository. See /content folder
* Maintenance free, client can edit all content using Decap CMS
* Uses Cloudinary to outsource image storage, saving build time
* Costs just $5/year to run website instead of $100+/year, only have to pay for domain ðŸ˜Ž
