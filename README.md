## Interesting Things About This Project
* Is a git-based CMS setup rather than API-based setup, meaning all editable content is stored in github repository. See /content folder, there's no backend!
* Maintenance free, client can edit all content using Decap CMS
* Uses Cloudinary to outsource image storage, saving build time
* Costs just **$5/year** to run website instead of **$100+/year**, only have to pay for domain ðŸ˜Ž
